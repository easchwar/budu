# Budu

Budu is a Rack-based web framework. It is built in the style of Rails. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'budu'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install budu

## Usage

Once you've included the gem in your gemfile, you have access to `Budu::Application`. 
If you have your app's application.rb inherit from it, you can run it with `rackup`.
